## Status

This was imported from the Spring and the content will be reviewed before class in a Just-In-Time fashion.

## About

This is the repo for the IS452 AO class materials that I can make public, but mainly for the notebooks containing my lecure notes and occasionaly slides.  This doesn't contain everything for the class.
