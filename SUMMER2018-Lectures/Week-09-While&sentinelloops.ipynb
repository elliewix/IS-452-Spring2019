    "# What do we mean by loops?\n",

    "Honestly, this is a good question.  There is a lot of language in programming that was created on the fly and: \n",
    "\n",
    "* was never technically correct but understood by the community of practice\n",
    "* once was technically correct but no longer correct with modern systems, but the term is stil used for historical tradition\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we mean when we use the word loop to describe a structure? It can mean many things!  For example, a for loop in Python repeats a block of code over items in a sequence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# DEPRECATED While loops\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to data processing in python, the while loop is only deployed when the for loop won't cut it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While loops are the standard way to loop for some languages, but not so much in python.  There are certain tasks, such as interactive programs, where the while loop is almost always what you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class is dealing with data, which is usually in files so you know exactly how many times to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop is valuable in the cases when you don't know how many times you'll need to run through things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this isn't something that you'll use a huge amount, you should still know about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A for loop goes over all the things and does whatever you want for all of them.  You can read that as \"for each in that thing...\".  Meanwhile, a while loop gets to loop over and over until it's question is answered correctly.  It has one question and will go until tha question comes up as true.\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as that condition is met, the while loop is done.  This is great for conditions of trying to act as a gatekeeper for crappy user input, or waiting for a command from a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not always a great choice for dealing with data, because we are almost always dealing with a known amount of stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other limitation of the while loop is that you have to do all the legwork.  You can't just tell it to loop over all the things in a file, because that's the purpose of a for loop.  It will keep repeating the question, and it's up to you to traverse what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "So counters and other incrementers are required."
