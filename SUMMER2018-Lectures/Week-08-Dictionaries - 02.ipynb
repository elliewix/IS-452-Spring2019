    "### But first, what data types do we know about?\n",
    "By this point, we have dealt with a number of different data types. Let's review them: \n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Type|Description and how to recognize|How can we use these items?| Mutable? |\n",
    "|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n",
    "| **integer / float**      | These are numbers and decimals. They can only be represented (most of the time) by 0-9. |  They allow you to do things associated with counting/mathematics | NO|\n",
    "| **string**      | A list of characters (a-z, A-Z, A-z, 0-9, special characters, etc). Noted by ' and ''' depending on their need.  | We can use them for all sorts of reasons and in innumerable ways.   | NO\n",
    "| **list** | Noted by `[]` and these are a collection of values (integers/strings, for example) and are separated by a comma.       | Lists can be used in FOR Loops to do a number of things. Get your content into a list and tons of stuff can be done with it     | YES|\n",
    "| **Bool** | This datatype is basically 1 of 2 values: True or False| Works as a way to conditionally deal with a for loop through IF statements. e.g. IF X is TRUE, DO THIS   | NO| \n",
    "| **Tuple** | Tuples are a group of values like a list and are manipulated in similar ways. But, tuples are fixed in size once they are assigned.  | These are not changable once they are created so useful when \"order and position\" are necessary | NO |\n",
    "|**NEW! Dictionary** | These are lists that hold KEY (think header row of a datasheet) and values(everything below the header). Noted by the use of {} brackets.  | You can use these when you have a row of a list that maps to the other data in the list. | YES | \n",

    "#### Mutation, Mutability, Unable to Mutate, Changes, and..what the what?\n",
    "What is that column called *MUTABLE*? Well, this is something important to consider. Different types of data are mutatable or to use a simpler phrase, \"a mutable object can change its state or contents and immutable objects cannot.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when you're doing Python, you don't actually change the existing string. For example, when you read Dracula into memory, it'll be there for forever in that state. You can then do something to that immutable object but in doing that, you create a new object. Another way to refer to this is that you use commands to alter a string. But the string does not change. It instead becomes a new variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that last line about dictionaries. Dictionaries are mutable. This means you can change their content!\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a dictionary? Well i'm glad you asked!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Dictionaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are like lists in that they hold collections of data.  However, as we discussed with the for and while loops, they have fundamentallf different purposes and so they act in very different ways.  Don't try to understand dictionaries like you understand lists.  Yes, they each hold things, but that's where similarites stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a dictionary as a small database.  It has two pieces:  unique IDs (keys), and associated records (values).  We call these keys and values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Think of an apartment building\n",
    "\n",
    "Your apartment has a unique address.  First off, the street address tells you which unique buildng you want to find.  There may be several identical buildings, but each has a unique address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside that apartment building there are unit IDs.  These may be letters (A, B, etc), labels (Garden, Penthouse, etc), or numbers (6, 303. etc).  Many apartment buildings share the same numbering systems, and this is fine because that apartment belongs to that building.  So the unique combination of street address and unit number can uniquly identify a unit in the same city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside these units you can hold whatever you want.  Usually household goods, food, pets, collectables, human bodies, etc.  The idea is that in order to access this unit, you must go into a building and enter a specific ID.  The IDs in that unit must be unique.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You also have to access things in order.  So you can't just directly go into an apartment number.  Even if that apartment door is outside, you still have to find the building.  Imagine saying, \"Hi, I live in New York City and I likein apartment 3.  The party will be at 8pm.\"  Will anyone be at your party?  Not so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analogy, the building is our dictionary.  The street address is our variable name, and the unit number is our key.  You use the key with the variable name to access the contents of that unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's pretty much it."
