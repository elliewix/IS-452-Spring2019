    "\n",
    "* as their **explicit meaning** (so the numbers are directly meaningful)\n",
    "* as a **transformed meaning** (so you can add 1 or do something else to the position number to make it meaningful)\n",
    "* with a **referenced meaning** (such that you can use the position number to look up the meaning).\n",
    "* with an **structural meaning** (where the position in the structure of the data itself is meaningful)\n",
    "\n",
    "These items can also be individually manipulated.  Once referenced, they can be stored in memory, placed in another structure, and used as a source for further data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You may not have picked up on it as well, but we were also using a referenced meaning.  When we wrote the `range()` to produce the position numbers (that we could transform into our human readable line numbers), there wasn't actually any real connection between that range and the list.  Neither knew about eachother, but we knew about each and knew that their patterns and structures were compatible.  So we were able to craft a `range` call that produced numbers that we could use to look up the line numbers that we wanted.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many of these things are \"hands off the keyboard and think\" problems.  Your code development process will be in stages, where you apply patterns and elements on the same block of code.  Much like a painting of a person involves wire framing and sketching, there's a non/linear process involved.  You will not be writing this one line by line.  You'll be adding things in with passes, checking your work along the way.  Here is a general thought process for considering these things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Identify the sequence in question. \n",
    "    * Where does it live and what is the variable name?  Do you need to transform the sequence?  \n",
    "2.  Run the sequence through a for loop printing out the iterable item until the individual results are what you want.  Don't worry about getting too far into the deep end here, becuase you can further extract out the data you want from the iterable.  What you're after is isolating the individual data containers.\n",
    "    * Just because it is a sequence doesn't mean that the what a for loop will grab from it will be what you want.  This can be the roughest stage, and often requires experimentation.  You may need to split a string up into a list, or do some fun slicing stuff, etc. \n",
    "3.  Inside your loop, transform or extract whatever you need outside of the iterable variable.\n",
    "    * You're going to do this inside of the body of your for loop, and NEVER in your opening for loop line of code.\n",
    "4.  Once you have the specific data points that you want to collect printing out in your for loop, start your accumulator process as normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What's our data granularity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we explored a poem and found that our unit of analysis of interest are the individual lines.  That made it easy because python knows about lines and has functions designed to easily interact with them.  In this case, our individual data entities records about the dataset.  This sort of thing, especially with the variability in number of lines within each record, is not something that python is able to immediately interact with without us doing some more leg work.  Our recourse for this issue is to use the tools inside of python to encode these chunks as individual data entries.  Once we have the individual records out we can operate on them independently and extract the information out.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern of breaking the data apart so that we can apply broader (easier) methods of splitting individual data points out will be a common one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a moment to consider the Raven again.  Say that we want to know about the words in each stanza.  We could use regular `.split()` on the entire poem and get all the words.  We'd have the granularity that we want (the words) but the membership information would then be gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our basic for loop over lines through the poem:  it allows us to isolate each line at a time such that we can manipulate or take measurements from that line and infer that those measurements we get belong to that line because it is the one we are looping over at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example of why using the `range(0, len(raven_lines), 7)` function to make the position numbers and look up the line versus just doing a list slice (`::7`) gave us the same content back (the first line of each stanza), but using the list slicing method lost the line number information in the process.  That origin information could not always be dependably derived back from the individual line itself, and thus we depend on our iterable variable within the `range` loop to represent that component metadata about the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike our pattern where we used `range` to generate the line numbers, and the content (the numbers) that we generated with `range` wasn't directly related to our original content, but this time we're going to be looping over our actual data.  We used a known pattern to (correctly!) generate position numbers.  So there was a certain trust that we had to put into place to make the things work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time around we are splitting our data into chunks so that we can individually act on the data inside of it.  This means that instead of getting out all the lines that have the funder information and doing something fancy to figure out which chunk it was from, we can take out all the chunks and then get the funder lines from there.  Because we are isolating the data records from each other, we can use a pretty unfancy method of getting out the lines that we want.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the last line of each record is the download count for that dataset.  That location rule would be impossible to use if we weren't isolating each chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to answer our question:  we have several granularities.\n",
    "\n",
