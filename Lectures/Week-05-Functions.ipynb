    "* __define a function__:  this is where you define the name, parameters, and code for your functions.  You do this with your `def` block.  E.g. `def name():`\n",
    "* __call a function__:  this is when you actually call the function to execute, and you do this via `name()` somewhere in your code\n",
    "* __parameters/arguments__:  these are the values you want to give the function when you call it, you can have 0 parameters/arguments\n",
    "* __'passing' values__: this is how you give the function the parameters and get values back, passing means that the value is handed off in the system such that it can be saved and processed.  This is different from printing values, which just spits the value out to the console and you can capture and save that value.\n",

    "Functions capture and host a select chunk of code that can be repeatedly called.  These are widely used to help keep the flow of longer programs clear, because you can modularize the processing elsewhere.  There are also modules with specialized functions that we import and use for specific tasks as we need them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So this is an element you can add into your program to make the structure of the program more organized or cleaner to understand, and less something that is necessary to help solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can theoretically contain any piece of code, which means that people use them in a wide variety of styles and purposes.  There are books and many opinions on best practices for how to craft and use functions, so there's a lot of creativity.  This means that the structure of defining a function won't dictate to you how it should be used, so a lot of the work is your responsibility to keep yourself in line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When starting out with functions, think about elements that you might want to repeat over and over.  You can put all that code into a funtion, and then you just have to call the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also want to use a function when your code is getting very long and you are having a hard time following what is going on in your program.  This is particularly useful when you have many levels of granularity and thus you program is starting to have many levels of indents.  For example:\n",

    "                ...\n",
    "```\n",

    "This is getting pretty unreadable even with no code under any of these things.  Imagine this code block, but with many lines of code for the processing under each.  You'll have a hard time understanding which for loop each piece of code belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this kind of case, we can first try to snip out the longest chunk of processing code and putting that into a function.  You could also consider making each of these a separate function, processing each level of granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for file in files:\n",
    "    records = get_records(file)\n",
    "    for record in records:\n",
    "        data = process_record(record)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is still very much abstract, but imagine that all the processing for lines and words was sent off to live in the `process_record` function.  In this case, all the processing work has been sent out to `get_records` and `process_record`, so this might me all the code there is in the main processing section of our program.  This can make the control flow easier to understand because all the processing and data manipulation elements have been isolated. \n",

    "A function will have three phases in your code.  This doesn't mean that these phases are traversed in order and never revisited, but this is how your code will be structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Thinking_ phase\n",
    "    * This is another 'hands off the keyboard' phase where you sit and think through the reason behind the function.  You need to think about the purpose of the function, names, and intended actions.\n",
    "2. _Defining_ phase\n",
    "    * This is where the function is defined in your code (and how to do that is the next section).  Functions are usually defined in the beginning or your script, although this isn't required.  You're going to write code according to the specifications that you determined in phase 1.  Well, there will be more questions you can't ask until you start the coding process, but the larger questions need to be answered in phase 1 before getting here.\n",
    "    * Once a function is defined, Python justs knows about it and what it does.  None of the code inside of it has been executed yet.  \n",
    "    * This definition must happen before you call the function.  The exception to this is when you may have multiple function definitions, which we are not at yet and will not discuss further. \n",
    "2.  _Calling_ phase\n",
    "    * Now that Python has learned about the function, you can make it actually execute the code.  You do this by calling the function.  Calling a function must come after you have defined it."

    "\n",
    "1. Design phase (remember that these are thinking tasks here, so you can answer phase 1 items in your own natural lanugage)\n",
    "    1. what do you want to name the function?\n",
    "        * follow normal variable naming protocols\n",
    "    2. what should the function take as input, if anything?\n",
    "        * Inputs (parameters) are optional, but you could have one or many coming in.  There's other nuance here, but we're going to start with the mose generic form.\n",
    "    3. what does the function need to do?  (this answer may be very abstract when starting out)\n",
    "        * This is your 'do stuff' step.\n",
    "    4. what should the function return? or: what should the function give back to you\n",
    "        * While you can choose to not return something, we won't be doing that.\n",
    "        * You must pick one and only one object to return.  You can get away with returning multiple things by returning a data collection object, but we'll be sticking to strings and numbers for now.\n",
    "2. Defining phase (remember that this phase only teaches Python about your function.  None of the code in the body of the function has actually been executed after this phase).\n",
    "    1. Add the `def` block line in, providing the function name you chose.\n",
    "        * So you'll have `def whatever():` thus far\n",
    "    2. Add the parameter variables into the `()` of the def block\n",
    "        * Give these sensible names that you'll remember later, do not just ay x and y.\n",
    "        * You will provide these in the order that they should be provided when calling the function, and the variable names separated bf commas.  Leave the `()` empty if you aren't requiring that the function take any input.\n",
    "        * So you'll have `def whatever(thing1, thing2):` at this point\n",
    "    3. Inside the function definition block (so indented under the `def` line), add your do stuff items.\n",
    "        * So you'll have \n",
    "        ```python \n",
    "        def whatever(thing1, thing2):\n",
    "            new = thing1 + thing2\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    4. Add your return statement\n",
    "        * this is a separate step because it will always come last in your function.\n",
    "        * it should always come last because your function execution will immediately stop as soon as Python hits a return statement.\n",
    "        * `return` is a keyword and not a function, so there aren't any `()`.  Provide the single object that you want to return after the keyword.  Do not add multiple items after this separated by commas. It'll look like it's working, but not working as you are intending.  So yes you can return back data collections.  \n",
    "        * So you'll have \n",
    "        ```python \n",
    "        def whatever(thing1, thing2):\n",

    "            return new # see? no ()!\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "3. Calling phase (now is the time to make the code actually work.  When you call the function you are finally asking Python to actually execute the code now).\n",
    "    1. Somewhere later in your code, you'll call the function with the function's name and `()`.  You'll add this in your main code indent area, and not inside your function definition. \n",
    "    2. Provide the input values in the `()` according to how you defined it.  So if you said `def student(name, age):`, then you must provide the parameter inputs in that order. \n",
    "    3.  Choose where you want the returned results to go.  You essentially have two choices:  print it or save it to a variable.  I suggest saving it to a variable, that way you have the value to mess with later.\n",
    "        * So you'll have \n",
