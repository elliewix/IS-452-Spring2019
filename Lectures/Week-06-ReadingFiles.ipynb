    "# Week 6: Reading Files!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we start getting into the good stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we're learning the basics of handling files for reading in and writing out.  We're used to our operating systems handling all these things for us, so we need to reproduce those backend mechanisms ourselves.  This is a topic where even they very high level language of python starts feeling very low level (closer to computers than human language).  As you start out, you may have to rely on just rotely reproducing these patterns.  So long as you know how they are operating, you can reasonably move forward without really understanding what is happening.  That said, this can be a dangerous game when you are writing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find that there are 3 main patterns for reading in files and processing the data.  These 3 are core to python and you will find that they are roughly interchangable.  Not that they do the same things, but that you can almost always accomplish whatever you need to do with the file contents no matter which pattern you choose to use.  \n",
    "Nearly all students find that they have a favorite.  This week's homework forces you to use all three, because sometimes your go-to pattern isn't the best.  But moving forward, you should be able to use your favorite most of the times.  The division usually happens between readline() and readlines()/read().  Much like knitting and crochet, one side usually finds the other to be unfathomable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll have to fuss at things in different ways, but don't worry about trying to use the 'right' one.  I suggest that you use the one you understand the most and go from there.  As you gain more python experience you'll get more comfortable and start adding in more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless the assignment names a specific method to be used, you should use the method that you are the most comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are 3 basic methods of reading in files, each is going to have roughly the same framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the file in whichever mode (reading or writing) you need \n",
    "    * This will be with `file_in = open(file_path, mode)` (note that this is just the pattern to use, you'll have to supply the file path and mode values yourself)\n",
    "    * Remember that you will always have to do an assignment statement to save the file object so you can act on it later.  I'm using `file_in` as an example variable name, but you can change it.\n",
    "    * This creates you file IO object you will then mess with in step 2\n",
    "    * you may need to have `open(file_path, mode, encoding = 'utf-8')` if your computer is based in another lanugage.\n",
    "2. Do stuff to that file IO object\n",
    "    * This is where each well be really different, but you'll be doing various actions to your `file_in` object, or whatever the variable name of your file IO object is.\n",
    "3. Close the file.\n",
    "    * this will always be the same pattern, `file_in.close()`. (replace `file_in` with your file IO variable name)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ways of handling files in sort of a one shot, but we'll get to that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to keep in mind:  the variable that you create with your `open()` expression will be your access point to the content of that file.  The content within that file is accessed by that object at your direction.  That is the purpose of this object.  This object is how python knows about your file.  But this doesn't mean that the file IO object knows about your file's content.  You'll need to direct that object to access or write the content that you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some other cautions \n",
    "\n",
    "Just a word of warning, there are some packages (like pandas) have their own methods for reading in files that take care of all these things for you, so you won't see the use of `open()`, `.close()`, or any other functions for reading the file contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also only be using plain text files for the file reading methods that we will be discussing here.  They will not work with propietary files like Word or Excel documents.  This is why certain packages have their own functions, as I mentioned just before.  They are equipped with additional tools to read those kinds of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Once you have that file object\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some structural considerations to keep in mind.  Some reading methods bypass having to deal with this stuff, but these things will still be happening even if you can get away without having to think about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The line, revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "We've spent several of our class sessions talking about the importance of lines in data processing.  Processing files is one of those reasons that we have focused on it.  Several of the file reading using navigates through the content based on newlines.  Newlines are really one of the most essential units of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The cursor\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't curse the cursor!  When you open a file for reading, there's an invisible cursor that the system places within that file.  It starts at the very beginning of the file and moves forward at your direction.  This means you can direct it to go forward character by character or line by line.  But you can never move backwards!  This means that you cannot 'reread' a file once you've already done a read action to it.  Once the cursor has found the end of the file, it stops and will not move forward unless it receives a command to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You open a file for reading\n",
    "2. You use `.read()` on that file.  The cursor is now at the end of the file.\n",
    "3. You cannot then use `.readlines()` on it after because `.readlines()` is going to attempt to start reading from the end of that file.  You'll get nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as we need to take some time to think about how we might want to loop over something, once you're accustomed to how these different methods interact with data, you can take some time to think about how you want to maneuver the cursor over the file that you are working with.  "

    "# The 3 essential patterns:  `.read()`, `.readlines()`, and `.readline()`\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to cover these in order of complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `.read()` reads the entire contents of the file into a single string, that you can then operate on like any normal string.  You will have a very short file reading section in your program.  This is often the best one to get started with, because we've been used to having all our text and data as one big string. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `.readlines()` will read an entire file into a list of the lines in the file, so each line in the file will become an element in that list.  This preserves all the order and content of the file, but gives it back to you in a handy structure of a list.  This in valuable, of course, when you want a list of lines and effectively is like running `.split('\\n')` on your file contents.  This helps you skip a step if that is your end goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `.readline()` will read the file line by line starting at the beginning.  This is the one where the cursor is something that you are directly interacting with, as it will only move forward within the file at your direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But why deal with files anyhow?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The other benefit is that the script and code can be made to be independent of the file.  For example, you may have a report to write each month on website log metricts.  Each month you receive a data file from a colleague, the server, or downloaded from something like google analytics.  The contents of the data file obviously change each month, but the structure does not.  This means that you can write your analysis script once and rerun it over the file that you recieve each month.  You may need to change parameters along the way, but the hard work is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## `.read()`: read all the things into one string\n",
    "\n",
    "When usure about which method to use, use `.read()`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basic formula for `.read()`, which will read the entire contents of the file into a single string.  We encountered this last week when I showed how we read in that data file all at once.  After you have read the file contents into that string, you will operate on that string instead of the file object.  The nice thing is now that the contents are a regular string, so you can use all your normal string operations on it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this is the point of this kind of thing.  The program reads the data into active memory, then does stuff to it.  This allows you to have a very large data file live outside of your script, perhaps even an another server or database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for `.read()` is one of the simplest, and this is usually done at the beginning of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1\n",
    "    * `fileIOvariable = open(filepath, mode)`\n",
    "* Step 2\n",
    "    * `file_contents = fileIOvariable.read()`\n",
    "* Step 3\n",
    "    * `fileIOvariable.close()`"

We can't just use line twice becuase it'll always be the second line, but we have another method in our pockets:  `.readline()`.  As we saw with our `range(5)` example, we can call `.readline()` an arbitrary number of times.  It won't mess up our for loop, but it will give us the next line, and push the cursor forward by one.\n",
